## 🎯 What I Do

I bridge the gap between **technical teams** and **customer success**. With experience across no-code platforms, APIs, data analytics, and customer operations, I help companies understand *why* customers struggle — and build systems so they don't have to struggle again.

My strongest value: I don't just solve tickets. I find the pattern behind the tickets, then build the process or tool that prevents the next hundred.

## 💬 How I Think About Problems

> "If I'm solving the same ticket three times in a week, something is broken — not in the product, but in the process. My job isn't just to fix it for the customer today. It's to make sure it doesn't break for the next one."
